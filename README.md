# Patrick D. Schloss R Series by Microinformatics
Hi there!

Thank you for stopping by. This repository is part of a complete learning journey I’ve curated for anyone interested in mastering R programming—from the very basics to more advanced concepts. Inspired by the incredible teaching style of **_Professor Dr. Patrick D. Schloss_**, I’ve named this series in his honor.

Inside this repository, you’ll find:
> Datasets used throughout the tutorials\
> R scripts for every lesson and hands-on practice\
> Step-by-step YouTube tutorial links organized in sequence

Whether you're just starting out or want to take your R skills to the next level, this course is designed to make learning engaging, practical, and beginner-friendly.

I hope you find it useful—and if you do, feel free to star ⭐ the repo and share it with fellow learners!

Happy Coding!\

## Patrick D. Schloss R Series by Microinformatics
Hi there!

Thank you for stopping by. This repository is part of a complete learning journey I’ve curated for anyone interested in mastering R programming—from the very basics to more advanced concepts. Inspired by the incredible teaching style of **_Professor Dr. Patrick D. Schloss_**, I’ve named this series in his honor.

Inside this repository, you’ll find:
- **Datasets used throughout the tutorials**
- **R scripts for every lesson and hands-on practice**
- **Step-by-step YouTube tutorial links organized in sequence**

Whether you're just starting out or want to take your R skills to the next level, this course is designed to make learning engaging, practical, and beginner-friendly.

I hope you find it useful—and if you do, feel free to star ⭐ the repo and share it with fellow learners!

Happy Coding!\

## Lecture 01 : Getting Started with R 

Learn how to install R, set up an R project, and get started with the basics of R programming. In this lecture I've highlighted the significance of **Base R** over the packages and libraries like *tidyverse*.\

## Lecture 02 : Data types, Variables, Vectors & Matrices in R

I've tried to explain the basic *data types* (i.e. numeric, character, boolean and complex), *variables* and different ways to assign a variable, *vectors* and creating vectors with the help of multiple function like, seq(), rep() and c(), different ways to access data from a vector (i.e. using indexing, other vectors, and keys etc), and creating and accessing data from inside a *matrix* to understand, how a lower triangle matrix can be read in R.\
